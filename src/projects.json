      "description":"For my final, independent CS project in high school, I learned about reinforcement learning through Andrej Karpathy's very well-written blogpost about training a neural network to play pong. Using policy gradients, I created a neural net that read the state of a Flappy Bird game and would predict the optimal move (jump or fall). After a few hundred iterations of training, the AI was able to play Flappy Bird without fail."

We trained three different classifiers: a custom recurrent neural net, a Google Cloud AutoML natural language classifier, and a Markov Chain using Wolfram Classify, and achieved over 80% accuracy."

Using long-range 'LoRA' radios, short-range transceivers, a Raspberry Pi Zero, and GPS modules, we created a decentralized mesh network that allows users to communicate with each other over 1 mi+ ranges without the use of internet. We ended up winning Facebook's award for 'best hack for building communities.'"

I created a tool that scraped several news sites, including CNN, Fox News, the Economist, and Reuters. Once it saved the sentences, I ran them through the Google Cloud Platform NLP toolkit for sentiment analysis. Then, I took the sentiments and graphed them in Tableau, to see if I could find any overall trends. To no one's surprise, there was a mild negative trend that appeared among the news sites, showing that over time, climate change writing gets more and more negative."
